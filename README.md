Comparative Analysis of Financial Literacy in Italy with Stata

## Description
I conducted a comprehensive analysis of financial literacy determinants using microdata from Bank of Italy surveys of
two waves, 2016 and 2020. 

The first question was how to be able to define an individual's level of financial literacy given the answers in the questionnaire. 
To do this, I considered only the financial economic questions and created a new variable that incorporated these outcomes in such a way that 4 levels of culture, absent, low, medium, and high, could be distinguished.


Lately I implemented applied econometric techniques to reveal key
factors influencing financial knowledge and its development at the panel level among respondents
interviewed in both years.

Then I selected variables that might be influential and analyzed their relationship to the variable of interest. 
Thereafter, given the longitudinal nature of the dataset, I used the random effects probit model to estimate the coefficients of the explanatory variables.

Finally, I selected individuals interviewed in both years 2016,2020 and tested with a statistical test whether there had been any changes on average about the level of financial literacy.
